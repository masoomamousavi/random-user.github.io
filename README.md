🎉Exciting News! 🎉
I just finished an interesting JavaScript project!🚀
It's a cool box with info about different people. You can click on the person icon to switch between users and see their details.

🔀 Plus, I've added a cool "Random User" button! 🎲 Click it, and you get a randomly selected user along with their unique set of attributes.
I'm so glad if you share your feedback🙏
